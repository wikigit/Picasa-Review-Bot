User:Picasa Review Bot on Wikimedia Commons was created to assist in reviewing the licenses of contributions from Picasa Web Albums. It goes over the images in Category:Picasa Web Albums review needed and marks them as reviewed if the license and the image file exactly match the full-size image from Picasa. Other images are left in that category for humans to review. An image may not be reviewed if the license does not match or if a thumbnail was uploaded.
